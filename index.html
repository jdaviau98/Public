        <h6>By Kira Garcia</h6>
        <h6>November 11, 2024</h6>
        <p>Wheather you're horrifying your teen with nauseating sex-ed analogies or watching TikToks while your toddler eats a bagel from the subway floor, face it: you're flailing in the vast chasm of your child's relentless needs. Why not get comfortable with your ineptitude? Discover your unique parenting-failure style with this fun quiz:</p>
        <h2>1.</h2>
        <p>Your eight-year-old has been watching chainsaw demonstrations on YouTube lately. You wake up on morning to a loud buzzings from the back yards, followed by a crash. Do you:</p>
        <p>(a) Put an extra frozen waffle in the toaster-sounds like she's working up an appetite.</p>
        <p>(b) Performatively yell at her so that the neighbors can hear, but then, in private, priase her-those landscaping skills will pay for college.</p>
        <p>(c) Chuckle into your cannabis-infused morning smoothie and turn up the volume on "The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives."</p>
        <h2>2.</h2>
        <p>You're about to board a six-hour flight home from a family vacation, and your five-year-old, who just ate twelve ripe plums, says his tummy hurts. DO you:</p>
        <p>(a) Tape the lower half of his body into a duty-free bag and hope for the best.</p>
        <p>(b) Take a business-class upgrade-the last one available-and wish your spouse good luck</p>
        <p>(c) Say, "what's your name, young man? You're a little young to be travelling alone!.," so that everyone can hear.</p>
        <h2>3.</h2>
        <p>Your Mother-in-law took your fourteen-year-old to see a foreign silm. OVer lunch at Olive Garden afterwards, he wonders aloud about a specific sexual practice that a character in the movie refers to. Do you:</p>
        <p>(a) Tell him to ask the server about it.</p>
        <p>(b) Describe it, using the breadsticks and onion rings as visual aids.</p>
        <p>(c) Put on a Chappell Roan playlist and hope he figures it out.</p>
        <h2>4.</h2>
        <p>Your sixth grader is doing makeup tutorials on Instagram that includes shoplifting tips and savage descriptions of her science teacher's apperence. Do you:</p>
        <p>(a) Tell her to try harder next time-she didn't even mention Mr. Welch's hisdeous breath.</p>
        <p>(b) Monetize her platform-you'll need cash for bail one day.</p>
        <p>(c) Explain that her glow definitely doesn't come from within, and her forsted blush ins't doing her any facours.</p>
        <h2>5.</h2>
        <p>Your adult child is pregnant with her guru's baby and asks to borrow ten thousand dollars so the two of them can start a colonic-hydrotherapy centre together. DO you:</p>
        <p>(a) Refuse-she's been rejecting your guru's advances for years, so this just feels rude.</p>
        <p>(b) Explain that your long-distance finac√©, Stanislav, has all your money tied up in a bitcoin mine.</p>
        <p>(c) Tell her you'll send twenty thousand is she gives you the placenta to use in a facial.</p>
